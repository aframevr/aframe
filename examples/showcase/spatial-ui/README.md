For quick prototyping and experimentation of Spatial Applications in your browser: desktop or any headset. 

## 

## TO DO

- Buttons drop shadows.
- Polish hover effect.
- Reflection / border of windows.
- Implement disolve effect when modal shows / hides.
- Replace MeshPhysicalMaterial with custom glass shader for window. It will allow for finer control of look (reflections, alpha blending to animate opacity...) [Meet SwiftUI for spatial computing
