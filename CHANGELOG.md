## 0.9.0 (February 7, 2019)

Performance improvements, WebXR support, Inspector updates!

We continued to battle test A-Frame to produce native-like VR experiences and
continue to add large performance gains.  We have also introduced initial WebXR
support! Although the spec is heavily in flux and yet to have feature parity
with WebVR 1.1, we had A-Frame get a head start to help test it out and smooth
out the changes.

- Bump to three.js r101 on a branch with a few extra patches for WebXR support (f9f314).
- WebXR support (#3875).
- Remove `<a-animation>` in favor of new animation component (#3678).
- Remove `collada-model` component (#3866).
- Add `renderer.colorManagement` property (disabled by default) to accurately match colors against modeling tools, but may changes in scene colors when flipped on. `renderer.gammaFactor` will be set to 2.2. Call `scene.renderer.systems.applyColorCorrection` on `THREE.Color`s and `THREE.Texture`s to normalize changes (#3757).
- Have raycasters only intersect against objects defined via `.setObject3D`. `raycaster.objects` should be specified (e.g., `objects: [data-raycastable] or objects: .raycastable`) because raycasting is expensive. `raycaster.recursive` property removed (#3980) but will default to be recursive only under objects defined via `.setObject3D` (#3652).
- Add `renderer` component (#3757).
- `antialias` attribute moved to `renderer.antialias`.
- Raycaster events such as `raycaster-intersected` no longer directly contain intersection data. Use `.getIntersection` function supplied in event detail or `el.components.raycaster.getIntersection(el)` to retrieve intersection data. Done to reduce garbage (a87e3b).
- Disable link portal appearance by default (`link.visualAspectEnabled`), link component defaults to purely to listening to an event to trigger navigation (#3743).

## 0.4.0 (December 16, 2016)

0.4.0 contains Oculus Touch controller support, integration with the Registry
by means of the Inspector, API polish, and bug fixes.

### Major Changes

- `getAttribute` returns full computed rather than just defined component data set. (#1925)
- `setAttribute` when passed an object (i.e., `setAttribute('material', {color: 'red'})`) no longer clobbers existing component data, it will instead *extend* existing component data. Pass a `true` flag as the third argument to clobber existing data.
- Asset property type will directly pass the video element to a component if the value is a selector. (#2129)
- Refactored primitives to fix component dependencies and initialization ordering. (#2106)
- Removed `transforms` feature from the `registerPrimitive` API. (#2045)
- Removed deprecated `look-at` component. (#1913)
- Removed deprecated Declarative Events API (`<a-event>`). (#1914)

### Deprecations

- `getComputedAttribute` deprecated in favor of `getAttribute`. `getDOMAttribute` does what `getAttribute` used to do. (#1925)
- `src` schema property type deprecated in favor of `asset`, `audio`, `map`, `model` schema property types. (#2003)
- `AFRAME.utils.isMobile`, `AFRAME.utils.isGearVR`, `AFRAME.utils.checkHeadsetConnected`, and `AFRAME.utils.isIOS` have all moved to the `AFRAME.utils.device` namespace.

### Known Issues

- A regression in the October 29th version of Chromium passes microsecond-based
  timestamp into `requestAnimationFrame` instead of milliseconds, breaking
  animations.

### 0.3.2 (October 12, 2016)

- WebVR 1.1 API support (#1931)

### 0.3.1 (August 25, 2016)

- Fixed requiring A-Frame with Browserify from npm. (#1824)

## 0.3.0 (August 17, 2016)

0.3.0 improves performance, adds support for the WebVR 1.0 API, and adds
tracked controllers (using experimental Gamepad APIs).

### Major Changes

- WebVR 1.0 API support. (#1423)
- Default camera is now positioned at `0, 1.6, 0` rather than `0, 1.8, -4`. In VR mode, the `1.6m` height offset as defined by `camera.userHeight` is removed. (#1474, #1718)
- Components no longer serialize stringified data to the DOM for performance. Introduced debug mode and flush-to-DOM methods. (#1323)
- No longer able to provide own `<canvas>` element. (#1474)
- Geometries default to be [BufferGeometry](http://threejs.org/docs/#Reference/Core/BufferGeometry)s, saving memory at the cost of being more difficult to manually manipulate. Use `geometry="buffer: false"` to disable. (#633) -- Geometry data is preserved in `geometry.metadata`. (#1557).
- Removed deprecated declarative events, loader component, and `<a-cube>`. (29446e0)
- Abstract raycasting-related properties out of the cursor component into the raycaster component. (#1196)
- Have shaders handle applying texture objects to material objects rather than material system. (2cee9eb)
- Removed geometry component's `translate` property, added a `pivot` component in `extras/`. (#1339)
- Renamed `defaultAttributes` to `defaultComponents` in `registerPrimitive` API. (#1460)
- Default lighting setup tweaked. (#1478)
- Made `sound.src` use the `src` property type. Sound URLs must now either be wrapped in `url()` or a selector to an `<audio>` element. (#1629)
- Added A-Frame Code of Conduct. (#954)
- Reduced webvr-polyfill `BUFFER_SCALE` to `1 / window.devicePixelRatio` only for iOS versions under 10 as a workaround to a Webkit bug. This will cause decrease resolutions on iPhone VR mode temporarily. It can be overridden in `window.WebVRConfig.BUFFER_SCALE`, but will cause canvas sizing issues upon entering stereo causing people to have to rotate their phones back and forth. (#1803)

### Deprecations

- Declarative Events deprecated in favor of [ngokevin/aframe-event-set-component](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-event-set-component). (#1634)
- `look-at` component deprecated and moved to [ngokevin/aframe-look-at-component](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-look-at-component). (#1447)

- Added support for `<canvas>` to be a source of texture for materials. (#1567)
- Added utility functions for getting and setting properties of multi-prop components. (#1595)
- `selectorAll` property type now converts `NodeList` to `Array`. (#1642)
- Changed default stats UI background color to gray. (#1644)
- Exposed list of registered primitives. (#1643)

- Added cursor grabbing styles to look-controls component. (#1680)
- Added support for mixins being attached at runtime, done to support a third-party CSS syntax for components. (#1610)

- Fixed single-property components with a default truthy value not obeying truthiness if defined in HTML without a value. (#1631)
- Fixed spotlight angles. (#1728)

## 0.2.0 (March 25, 2016)

0.2.0 improves extensibility:

- Component API has been greatly enhanced with more lifecycle methods, schema options, and property types.
- Components can be applied to primitives (e.g., `<a-box>`).
- Custom GLSL shaders can be shared and registered to provide more visual effects.

### Major Changes

- `aframe-core` merged with `aframe`. `window.AFRAME` exposes what `aframe-core` was exposing previously (e.g., `AFRAME.registerComponent` vs.  `AFRAME.aframeCore.registerComponent`). (#368)
- `<a-assets>` must be declared within `<a-scene>`. (#910)
- `<a-entity>.object3D` is now a `THREE.Group`. Use `<a-entity>.setObject3D` API to add new 3D objects from components. (#847)
- Bumped three.js to r74 stable. (#1006)
- npm points to a prebuilt bundle of `dist/aframe.js`.
- Scene `<canvas>` elements are now appended to the scene by default rather than to the document body. The scene can specify which `<canvas>` to render to. (c0aa360)
- Primitives such as `<a-sphere>` directly extend `<a-entity>` rather than template them. They can be registered with `AFRAME.registerPrimitive`. (#883)
- `<a-template>` and HTML Imports logic have been removed. Use https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-template-component in the meantime. (#883)
- `<a-camera>` no longer creates a cursor on its own. Do `<a-camera><a-cursor></a-cursor></a-camera>` instead. (#883)
- Default geometry `depth`, `height`, `width` property values changed from `2` to `1`. (#1245)
- Default color of primitive elements such as `<a-box>` changed to `#FFF` to not interfere with textures. (#1245)

### Deprecations

- `loader` component deprecated in favor of `collada-model` and `obj-model`. (#913)
- `<a-model>` deprecated in favor of `<a-collada-model>` and `<a-obj-model>`. (#883)
- `<a-EVENTNAME>` elements such as `<a-mouseenter>` deprecated in favor of `<a-event name="EVENTNAME">` (unstable). (#883)
- `<a-cube>` deprecated in favor of `<a-box>`. (#883)

### Enhancements

- Introduced *shaders* to extend the material component and to register custom GLSL shaders. (#861)
- Component *property types*. Property types define how a component property is parsed and stringified. Custom property types can be registered or defined inline with the property in the schema. Built-in property types include `array`, `boolean`, `color`, `int`, `number`, `selector`, `selectorAll`, `string`, `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4`. (d35e56e)
- *Single-property components*. A component can define itself as consisting of only one property by specifying a type and/or a default value in the schema. (d35e56e)
- *Asset management system* that blocks scene render.
- *Play/pause* methods on entities and play/pause handlers on components. (9238861)
- *Tick* method on components to register a function called on each scene tick. (#823)
- Support for loading *`.OBJ`* and `.MTL` assets. (#788)
- *Texture caching* for better performance when reusing textures. (#1116)
- Components can be attached to primitives (e.g., `<a-sphere>`). (#883)
- Introduce *systems* API (unstable) to provide global scope and services for components. They can be registered wtih `AFRAME.registerSystem`. (#924)
- Entities, including the scene, wait for their children to load before emitting the `loaded` event. (a8a4f06)
- Entities emit `child-attach` when children are attached.
- Most `<a-scene>` logic moved to configurable components and systems. (#776)
- Support for *multiple cameras* in a scene and switching between them. (#745)
- Added more events for scene VR mode, material component, model components, and sound component.
- Default geometry `segments*` property values increased for smoother meshes. (#1245)
- Added more meta tags for mobile web-app capabilities, automatically set properties to video elements for inline video playback on iOS. (#316)
- Added three.js stats to the stats component. (#1223)
- Added `<a-torus>` primitive. (#1184)

## Fixes

- Stop `<a-animation>` when detached. (#727)
- Fixed `<a-animation>` `begin` attribute. (#885)
- Keyboard shortcuts no longer trigger when used alongside modifier keys. (#1211)
- Fixed viewport issues in Twitter webview on IOS. (#1174)
- Raycaster and cursor components can now intersect with loaded models. (#1166)

### v0.1.3 (Februrary 18, 2016)
