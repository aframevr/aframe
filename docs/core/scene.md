A scene is represented by the `<a-scene>` element. The scene is the global root object, and all [entities][entity] are contained within the scene.

The scene inherits from the [`Entity`][entity] class so it inherits all of its properties, its methods, the ability to attach components, and the behavior to wait for all of its child nodes (e.g., `<a-assets>` and `<a-entity>`) to load before kicking off the render loop.

## Example

```html
<a-scene>
  <a-assets>
    <img id="texture" src="texture.png">
  </a-assets>

  <a-box src="#texture"></a-box>
</a-scene>
```

|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| enter-vr     | User has entered VR and headset started presenting content. |
| exit-vr      | User has exited VR and headset stopped presenting content.  |
| loaded       | All nodes have loaded.                             |
| render-start | Render loop has started.            |

## Scene Components

Components can be attached to the scene as well as entities:

```html
<a-scene canvas="canvas: #my-canvas" fog stats>
```

A-Frame ships with a few components to configure the scene:

- [canvas][canvas] - Configure which canvas to render to, or the width/height of the injected canvas.
- [fog][fog] - Scene fog.
- [keyboard-shortcuts][keyboard-shortcuts] - Toggle keyboard shortcuts.
- [stats][stats] - Toggle performance stats.
- [vr-mode-ui][vr-mode-ui] - Toggle UI for entering and exiting VR.

## Running Content Scripts on the Scene

When running JavaScript on the scene, wait for it to finish loading first:

```js
var scene = document.querySelector('a-scene');

if (scene.hasLoaded) {
  run();
} else {
  scene.addEventListener('loaded', run);
}

function run () {
  var entity = scene.querySelector('a-entity');
  entity.setAttribute('material', 'color', 'red');
}
```
