An entity is represented by the `<a-entity>` element. As defined in the
[entity-component-system pattern][ecs], entities are placeholder objects to
which we plug in components to in order to provide them apperance, behavior,
and functionality.

In A-Frame, entities are inherently attached with the [position][position],
[rotation][rotation], and [scale][scale] components.

<!--toc-->

## Example

Consider the entity below. By itself, it has no appearance, behavior, or functionality. It does nothing:

```html
<a-entity>
```

We can attach components to it to make it render something or do something. To give it shape and appearance, we can attach the [geometry][geometry] and [material][material] components:

```html
<a-entity geometry="primitive: box" material="color: red">
```

Or to make it emit light, we can further attach the [light][light] component:

```html
<a-entity geometry="primitive: box" material="color: red"
          light="type: point; intensity: 2.0">
```

## Retrieving an Entity

We can simply retrieve an entity using DOM APIs.

```html
<a-entity id="mario"></a-entity>
```

```js
var el = document.querySelector('#mario');
```

Once we have an entity, we have access to all of its properties and methods, which are detailed below.

## Properties

### `components`

`<a-entity>.components` is an object of components attached to the entity. This gives us access to all of the entity's components including their data, methods, and API.

For example, if we wanted to grab an entity's three.js camera object or material object, we could reach into its components:

```js
var camera = document.querySelector('a-entity[camera]').components.camera.camera;
var material = document.querySelector('a-entity[material]').components.material.material;
```

Or if a component exposes an API, we can call its methods:

```js
document.querySelector('a-entity[sound]').components.sound.pause();
```

### `isPlaying`

Whether or not the entity is active and playing. If the entity is paused, then `isPlaying` will be false.

### `object3D`

`<a-entity>.object3D` is a reference to the entity's [three.js `Object3D`][object3D] representation. More specifically, `object3D` will be a `THREE.Group` object that may contain different types of `THREE.Object3D`s such as cameras, meshes, lights, or sounds:

```js
// Gaining access to the internal three.js scene graph.
var groupObject3D = document.querySelector('a-entity').object3D;
console.log(groupObject3D.parent);
console.log(groupObject3D.children);
```

The different types `Object3D`s can be accessed through `object3DMap`.

### `object3DMap`

An entity's `object3DMap` is a JavaScript object that gives access to the different types of `THREE.Object3D`s (e.g., camera, meshes, lights, sounds) that may have been registered by components.

For an entity with a [geometry][geometry] and [light][light] components attached, `object3DMap` might look like:

```js
{
  light: <THREE.Light Object>,
  mesh: <THREE.Mesh Object>
}
```

An entity's `THREE.Object3D`s can be managed using `getOrCreateObject3D`, `setObject3D`, and `removeObject3D`.

### `sceneEl`

An entity has a reference to its scene element.

```js
var sceneEl = document.querySelector('a-scene');
var entity = sceneEl.querySelector('a-entity');
console.log(entity.sceneEl === sceneEl);  // >> true.
```

## Methods

### `addState (stateName)`

`addState` will push a state onto the entity. This will emit the `stateadded` event, and the state can then be checked for existence using `.is`:


```js
entity.addEventListener('stateadded', function (evt) {
  if (evt.state === 'selected') {
    console.log('Entity now selected!');
  }
});

entity.addState('selected');
entity.is('selected');  // >> true
```

### `emit (name, detail, bubbles)`

`emit` emits a custom DOM event on the entity. For example, we can emit an event to
[trigger an animation][animation-begin]:

```js
// <a-entity>
//   <a-animation attribute="rotation" begin="rotate" to="0 360 0"></a-animation>
// </a-entity>
entity.emit('rotate');
```

We can also pass event detail or data as the second argument:

```js
entity.emit('collide', { target: collidingEntity });
```

The event will bubble by default. we can tell it not to bubble by passing `false` for `bubble`:

```js
entity.emit('sink', null, false);
```

### `flushToDOM (recursive)`

`flushToDOM` will manually serialize all of the entity's components' data and update the DOM.
Read more about [component-to-DOM serialization][component-to-dom-serialization].

### `getAttribute (attr)`

`getAttribute` can be used to retrieve parsed component data. If `attr` is the name of a registered component, `getAttribute` will return only the component data defined in the HTML as a parsed object. `getAttribute` for components is the partial form of `getComputedAttribute` since the returned component data does not include applied mixins or default values:

```js
// <a-entity geometry="primitive: box; width: 3">

entity.getAttribute('geometry');
// >> { primitive: "box", width: 3 }

entity.getAttribute('geometry').primitive;
// >> "box"

entity.getAttribute('geometry').height;
// >> undefined
```

If `attr` is not the name of a registered component, `getAttribute` will behave as it normally would:

```js
// <a-entity data-position="0 1 1">

entity.getAttribute('data-position');
// >> "0 1 1"
```

### `getComputedAttribute (attr)`

`getComputedAttribute` is similar to `getAttribute`, but it will return *all* of the component's properties for multi-property components. It can be thought of as an analog to [`getComputedStyle`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle), which in CSS returns all CSS properties after applying stylesheets and computations. `getComputedAttribute` will return all component properties after applying mixins and default values.

Compare the output of the above example of [`getAttribute`](#getAttribute):

```js
// <a-entity geometry="primitive: box; width: 3">

entity.getComputedAttribute('geometry');
// >> { primitive: "box", depth: 2, height: 2, translate: "0 0 0", width: 3, ... }

entity.getComputedAttribute('geometry').primitive;
// >> "box"

entity.getComputedAttribute('geometry').height;
// >> 2
```

More often we will want to use `getComputedAttribute` to inspect the component's data. Though sometimes we might want to use `getAttribute` to discern which properties were explicitly defined.

### `getObject3D (type)`

`getObject3D` looks up a child `THREE.Object3D` of the entity that is registered under `type` for `object3DMap`:

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('example-mesh', {
  init: function () {
    var el = this.el;
    el.getOrCreateObject3D('mesh', THREE.Mesh);
    el.getObject3D('mesh');  // Returns THREE.Mesh that was just created.
  }
});
```

### `getOrCreateObject3D (type, Constructor)`

If the entity does not have a `THREE.Object3D` registered under `type`, `getOrCreateObject3D` will register an instantiated `THREE.Object3D` using the passed `Constructor`. If the entity does have an `THREE.Object3D` registered under `type`, `getOrCreateObject3D` will act as `getObject3D`:

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('example-geometry', {
  update: function () {
    var mesh = this.el.getOrCreateObject3D('mesh', THREE.Mesh);
    mesh.geometry = new THREE.Geometry();
  }
});
```

### `pause ()`

`pause` will stop any dynamic behavior as defined by animations and components. When an entity is paused, it will stop all of its animations and call `Component.pause` on each of its components. It is up to the components to implement how they paused, but they generally remove event listeners and background behavior. An entity will call `pause` on all of its children when it is paused itself.

```js
// <a-entity id="spinning-jumping-ball">
entity.pause();
```

For example, the [look-controls component](../components/look-controls.md) on pause will remove event handlers that listen for input.

### `play ()`

`play` will start any dynamic behavior as defined by animations and components. This is automatically called when the entity is attached. When an entity calls `play`, it will call `play` on all of its children.

```js
entity.pause();
entity.play();
```

For example, the [sound component][sound] on play will begin playing the sound.

### `setAttribute (attr, value, componentAttrValue)`

If `attr` is not the name of a registered component or the component is a single-property component, `setAttribute` behaves mostly as it normally would:

```js
entity.setAttribute('visible', false);
```

Though if `attr` is the name of a registered component, it may handle special parsing for the value. For example, the [position component][position] is a single-property component, but its property type parser allows it to take an object:

```js
entity.setAttribute('position', { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 });
```

#### Putting Multi-Property Component Data

To set or replace component data for a multi-property component, we can pass the name of a registered component as the `attr`, and pass an object of properties as the `value`:

```js
// All previous properties for the light component will be removed and overwritten.
entity.setAttribute('light', {
  type: 'spot',
  distance: 30,
  intensity: 2.0
});
```

#### Updating Multi-Property Component Data

To update individual properties for a multi-property component, we can pass the name of registered component as the `attr`, a property name as the second argument, and the property value to set as the third argument:

```js
// All previous properties for the material component (besides the color)  will be unaffected.
entity.setAttribute('material', 'color', 'crimson');
```

### `setObject3D (type, obj)`

`setObject3D` will register the passed `obj`, a `THREE.Object3D`, as `type` under the entity's `object3DMap`. `obj` will be added as a child of the entity's root `object3D`. Passing in the value `null` for `obj` has the effect of unregistering the `THREE.Object3D` previously registered under `type`.

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('example-orthogonal-camera', {
  update: function () {
    this.el.setObject3D('camera', new THREE.OrthogonalCamera());
  }
});
```

### `removeAttribute (attr)`

If `attr` is the name of a registered component, along with removing the attribute from the DOM, `removeAttribute` will also detach the component from the entity, invoking the component's `remove` lifecycle method.

```js
entity.removeAttribute('sound');  // The entity will no longer play sound.
```

### `removeObject3D (type)`

`removeObject3D` removes the object specified by `type` from the entity's `THREE.Group` and thus from the scene. This will update the entity's `object3DMap`, setting the value of the `type` key to `null`. This is generally called from a component, often within the remove handler:

```js
AFRAME.registerComponent('example-light', {
  update: function () {
    this.el.setObject3D('light', new THREE.Light());
    // Light is now part of the scene.
    // object3DMap.light is now a THREE.Light() object.
  },

  remove: function () {
    this.el.removeObject3D('light');
    // Light is now removed from the scene.
    // object3DMap.light is now null.
  }
});
```

### `removeState (stateName)`

`removeState` will pop a state from the entity. This will emit the `stateremove` event, and the state can then be checked for its removal using `.is`:

```js
entity.addEventListener('stateremoved', function (evt) {
  if (evt.state === 'selected') {
    console.log('Entity no longer selected.');
  }
});

entity.addState('selected');
entity.is('selected');  // >> true

entity.removeState('selected');
entity.is('selected');  // >> false
```

#### Listening for Component Changes

We can use the `componentchanged` event to listen for changes to the entity:

```js
entity.addEventListener('componentchanged', function (evt) {
  if (evt.detail.name === 'position') {
    console.log('Entity has moved from', evt.detail.oldData, 'to', evt.detail.newData, '!');
  }
});
```

#### Listening for child elements being attached

We can use the `child-attached` event to listen for elements being attached:

```js
entity.addEventListener('child-attached', function(evt) {
  if (evt.detail.el.tagName.toLowerCase() === 'a-box') {
    console.log('a box element has been attached');
  };
));
