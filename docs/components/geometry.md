The `geometry` component defines the shape and size of an entity. The general geometry is defined by the `primitive` property. "Geometric primitives", in computer graphics, simply means an extremely basic shape. With the primitive defined, additional properties are used to further define the geometry. A `material` component is usually defined alongside the `geometry` component.

We will go through the basic primitives and their respective properties one by one.

| Property  | Description                                                                          | Default Value |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| primitive | One of `box`, `circle`, `cylinder`, `plane`, `ring`, `sphere`, `torus`, `torusKnot`. | None          |
| translate | Translates the geometry relative to its pivot point.                                 | 0 0 0         |

### Box

The box primitive defines boxes (square or rectangle).

```html
<a-entity geometry="primitive: box; width: 1; height: 1; depth: 1"></a-entity>
```

| Property  | Description                                    | Default Value |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| width     | Width (in meters) of the sides on the X axis.  | 2             |
| height    | Height (in meters) of the sides on the Y axis. | 2             |
| depth     | Depth (in meters) of the sides on the Z axis.  | 2             |

### Circle

The circle primitive defines two-dimensional circles, which can be complete circles or partial circles (like Pac-Man). Note that because it is flat, only a single side of the circle will be rendered if "side: double" is not specified on the `material` component.

```html
<a-entity geometry="primitive: circle; radius: 1" material="side: double"></a-entity>
```

| Property    | Description                                                                                                                           | Default Value |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| radius      | Radius (in meters) of the circle.                                                                                                     | 1             |
| segments    | Number of triangles to construct the circle, like pizza slices. A higher number of segments means the circle will be more round. | 8             |
| thetaStart  | Start angle for first segment. Can be used to define a partial circle.                                                        | 0             |
| thetaLength | The central angle (in degrees). Defaults to `360`, which makes for a complete circle.                                               | 360           |

### Cylinder Primitive

The cylinder primitive can define cylinders in the traditional sense like a Coca-Colaâ„¢ can, but it can also define shapes such as tubes and curved surfaces. We'll go over some of these cylinder recipes below.

#### Basic Cylinder

Traditional cylinders can be defined by using only a height and a radius:

```html
<a-entity geometry="primitive: cylinder; height: 3; radius: 2"></a-entity>
```

#### Tube

Tubes can be defined by making the cylinder open-ended, which removes the top and bottom surfaces of the cylinder such that the inside is visible. A double-sided material will be needed to render properly:

```html
<!-- Tube -->
<a-entity geometry="primitive: cylinder; openEnded: true" material="side: double"></a-entity>
```

#### Curved Surface

Curved surfaces can be defined by specifying the angle via `thetaLength` such that the cylinder doesn't curve all the way around, making the cylinder open-ended, and then making the material double-sided.

```html
<!-- Curved surface -->
<a-entity geometry="primitive: cylinder; openEnded: true; thetaLength: 180"
          material="side: double"></a-entity>
```

| Property       | Description                                                         | Default Value |

### Cone

Cones are essentially cylinders that have a different bottom radius than the top radius:

```html
<a-entity geometry="primitive: cone; radiusBottom: 1; radiusTop: 0.1"></a-entity>
```

| Property       | Description                                                         | Default Value |

### Plane

The plane primitive defines a flat surface. Note that because it is flat, only a single side of the plane will be rendered if `side: double` is not specified on the `material` component.

```html
<a-entity geometry="primitive: plane; height: 10; width: 10"
          material="side: double"></a-entity>
```

| height    | Height along the Y axis. | 2             |

### Ring

The ring geometry defines a flat ring, like a [CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc). Note that because it is flat, only a single side of the ring will be rendered if `side: double` is not specified on the `material` component.

```html
<a-entity geometry="primitive: ring; radiusInner: 0.5; radiusOuter: 1"
          material="side: double"></a-entity>
```

| Property      | Description                                                            | Default Value |

| segmentsTheta | Number of segments. A higher number means the ring will be more round. | 2             |
| segmentsPhi   | Number of triangles within each face defined by segmentsTheta.         | 8             |
| thetaStart    | Starting angle in degrees.                                             | 0             |

### Sphere

The sphere primitive can define spheres in the traditional sense like a basketball. But it can also define various polyhedrons and abstract shapes given that it can specify the number of horizontal and vertical angles and faces.

Sticking with a basic sphere, the default number of segments is high enough to make the sphere appear round.

```html
<a-entity geometry="primitive: sphere; radius: 2"></a-entity>
```

| Property       | Description                    | Default Value |
|----------------|--------------------------------|---------------|
| radius         | Radius of the sphere.          | 1             |
| segmentsWidth  | Number of horizontal segments. | 18            |
| segmentsHeight | Number of vertical segments.   | 36            |

| phiLength      | Horizontal sweep angle size.   | 360           |
| thetaStart     | Vertical starting angle.       | 0             |
| thetaLength    | Vertical sweep angle size.     | 360           |

### Torus

The torus primitive defines a donut shape.

```html
<!-- Half donut -->
<a-entity geometry="primitive: torus; radius: 2; radiusTubular: 0.5; arc: 180"></a-entity>
```

| Property        | Description                                                                                                     | Default Value |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| radius          | Radius of the outer edge of the torus.                                                                          | 1             |
| radiusTubular   | Radius of the tube.                                                                                             | 0.2           |

| segmentsTubular | Number of segments along the circumference of the tube face. A higher number means the tube will be more round. | 0             |
| arc             | Central angle.                                                                                                   | 360           |

### Torus Knot

The torus knot primitive defines a pretzel shape, the particular shape of which is defined by a pair of coprime integers, `p` and `q`. If `p` and `q` are not coprime the result will be a torus link.

```html
<a-entity geometry="primitive: torusKnot; p: 3; q:7"></a-entity>
```

| Property        | Description                                                                                                     | Default Value |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|

| radiusTubular   | Radius of the tubes of the torus knot.                                                                      | 0.2           |
| segmentsRadial  | Number of segments along the circumference of the tube ends. A higher number means the tube will be more round. | 36            |
| segmentsTubular | Number of segments along the circumference of the tube face. A higher number means the tube will be more round. | 8             |
| p               | Number that helps define the pretzel shape.                                                                     | 2             |
| q               | Number that helps define the pretzel shape.                                                                     | 3             |

## Geometry Translate

The `translate` property translates the geometry relative to its pivot point. It is defined as a coordinate.

```html
<!-- Translates the sphere such that the pivot point is at its bottom -->
<a-entity geometry="primitive: sphere; radius: 1; translate: 0 1 0"></a-entity>
```
