[invrproposal]: https://github.com/immersive-web/navigation#api-proposal

The link component connects between experiences and allows for traversing between VR web pages. When activated via an event, the link component sends the user to a different page, just like a normal web page redirect. To maintain VR across pages, the following conditions must apply:

- Your browser implements the WebXR [in-VR navigation proposal][invrproposal]. Notice that is not yet part of the standard. Support is experimental, varies accross browsers and it might require enabling manually in settings.

[sessiongranted]: https://github.com/immersive-web/navigation#api-proposal

- The destination Web page listens to the window [`sessiongranted`] event and enters VR. A-Frame experiences behave this way by default.

- At the moment, The Oculus Browser on Quest is the only browser shipping the [in-VR navigation proposal][invrproposal].

## Link UX

A link in VR can be anything such as grabbing onto an object, placing something
on our head, clicking something, even eating something! We provide a default
implementation of links as a portal or window, using a 360&deg; image thumbnail
to preview the destination.

The UX of link traversal will continue to refine as we iterate and experiment,
both in content and from the browser.

### Controls

[link-controls]: https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/examples/showcase/link-traversal/js/components/link-controls.js

The default UX of the link component as a portal can be interacted with using a
cursor or controllers. This is not provided directly in the A-Frame core, but
there is a [link-controls component in the A-Frame examples][link-controls]. This component
shows tooltips and provides button mappings for peeking and entering portals.

## Example

```html
<a-scene>
  <a-assets>
    <img id="homeThumbnail" src="home.jpg">
  </a-assets>

  <a-entity link="href: index.html; title: My Homepage; image: #homeThumbnail"></a-entity>
</a-scene>
```

We also provide a link primitive with a different syntax:

```html
<a-link href="index.html" title="My Homepage" image="#homeThumbnail"></a-link>
```

## Manually Navigating

[so]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/503093/how-do-i-redirect-to-another-webpage

To navigate manually, use `window.location` API. See this [StackOverflow question on navigating][so]. For example:

```js
window.location.href = 'https://supermedium.com/supercraft/';
// or window.location.replace
```
