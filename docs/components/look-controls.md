The look-controls component:

- Rotates the entity when we rotate a VR head-mounted display (HMD).
- Rotates the entity when we click-drag mouse.
- Rotates the entity when we touch-drag the touchscreen.

## Example

The look-controls component is usually used alongside the [camera
component](camera.md).

```html
<a-entity camera look-controls></a-entity>
```

## Caveats

If you want to create your own component for look controls, you will have to
copy and paste the HMD-tracking bits into your component. In the future, we may
have a system for people to more easily create their controls.
