The embedded component removes fullscreen CSS styles from A-Frame's `<canvas>`
element, making it easier to embed within the layout of an existing webpage. It
removes fixed positioning from the canvas and makes the Enter VR / Fullscreen
UI smaller.

## Example

```html
<a-scene embedded></a-scene>
```
