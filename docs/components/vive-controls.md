[trackedcontrols]: ./tracked-controls.md

The vive-controls component interfaces with the HTC Vive controllers/wands. It
wraps the [tracked-controls component][trackedcontrols] while adding button
mappings, events, and a Vive controller model that highlights the pressed
buttons (trigger, grip, menu, system) and trackpad.
