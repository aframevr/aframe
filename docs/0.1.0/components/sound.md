The `sound` component defines the entity as a source of sound or audio. The `sound` component is positional and is therefore affected by the [`position` component](position.html).

```html
<a-entity id="river" geometry="primitive: plane" material="color: blue"
          position="-10 0 0" sound="src: river.mp3; autoplay: true"></a-entity>
```

The `sound` component can also listen to an event before playing as well. For example, we might have a damage sound play every time a monster is clicked:

```html
<a-entity id="elmo" geometry="primitive: box" material="src: elmo.png"
          sound="src: ticklelaugh.mp3; on: click"></a-entity>

<a-entity cursor position="0 0 -5"></a-entity>
```
