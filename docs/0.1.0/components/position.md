The `position` component defines where an entity is placed in the scene's world space. It takes an XYZ coordinate as three space-delimited numbers. All entities inherently have the `position` component.

```html
<a-entity position="0 1 -1"></a-entity>
```

A-Frame uses a right-handed coordinate system where the negative Z axis extends into the screen. The table below assumes looking down the negative Z axis from the origin.

| Value | Description                                                  | Default Value |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------
| x     | Negative X axis extends left. Positive X Axis extends right. | 0             |
| y     | Negative Y axis extends up. Positive Y Axis extends down.    | 0             |
| z     | Negative Z axis extends in. Positive Z Axis extends out.     | 0             |
