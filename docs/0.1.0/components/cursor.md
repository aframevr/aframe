The `cursor` component defines interaction with the scene through clicking and gazing, by using a [raycaster](raycaster.html) to determine which object has been clicked. When the mouse is clicked, the closest visible entity intersecting the cursor will have a DOM `click` event triggered.

For example, we define a cursor in the shape of a ring positioned on the center of the screen. Whenever the cursor clicks on the cube, we can listen the the click event. This might feel familiar to web developers.

```html
<a-entity cursor="fuse: true; maxDistance: 30; timeout: 500"
          position="0 0 -5"
          geometry="primitive: ring"
          material="color: white; shader: flat">
</a-entity>

<a-entity id="cube" geometry="primitive: box" material="color: blue"></a-entity>
```

```js
document.querySelector('#cube').addEventListener('click', function () {
  this.setAttribute('material', 'color', 'red');
  console.log('I was clicked!');
});
```

|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| fuse        | Whether cursor should also be fuse-based.                                  | false          |
| maxDistance | Maximum distance to check for intersections on entities for clicks.        | 5              |
| timeout     | How long to wait (in milliseconds) to trigger a click event if fuse-based. | 1500           |

## Fuse-Based Cursor

If the cursor is set to be fuse-based, the cursor will trigger a click if the user gazes at one entity for a set amount of time. Imagine a laser strapped to the user's head, and the laser extends out into the scene. After the timeout, whatever entity the laser intersects first will be clicked.

Fuse-based interactions can feel natural for VR and do not require any additional input devices other than the headset.
