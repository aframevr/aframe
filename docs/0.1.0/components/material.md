The `material` component defines the appearance of an entity. It can define properties such as color, opacity, or texture. A [`geometry` component](geometry.html) is usually defined alongside the `material` component.

Here is an example defining a red material on a box geometry, creating a red cube.

```html
<a-entity geometry="primitive: box" material="color: red"></a-entity>
```

| Property     | Description                                                                                                                                    | Default Value |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| color        | Base color of the geometry.                                                                                                                    | #fff          |
| envMap       | Environment cubemap texture for reflections. Can be a selector to <a-cubemap> or a comma-separated list of URLs.                             | None          |
| height       | Height of video (in pixels), if defining a video texture.                                                                                      | 360           |
| metalness    | How metallic the material is from `0` to `1`. Does not apply if `shader` is set to `flat`.                                                     | 0.5           |
| opacity      | Extent of transparency. If the `transparent` property is not `true`, then the material will remain opaque and `opacity` will only affect color. | 1.0           |
| reflectivity | How reflective the material is from `0` to `1` if the `envMap` property is set.                                                               | 1.0           |
| repeat       | How many times a texture (defined by `src`) repeats in the X and Y direction.                                                                  | 1 1           |
| roughness    | How rough the material is from `0` to `1`. A rougher material will scatter reflected light in more directions than a smooth material. Does not apply if `shader` is set to `flat`. | 0.5 |
| transparent  | Whether material is transparent. Transparent entities are rendered after non-transparent entities.                                             | false         |
| shader       | Shading model. Defaults to physically based shading but can also be set to `flat` shading.                                                     | standard      |
| side         | Which sides of the mesh to render. Can be one of `front`, `back`, or `double`.                                                                 | front |
| src          | Image or video texture map. Can either be a selector to an `<img>` or `<video>`, or an inline URL.                                             | None          |
| width        | Width of video (in pixels), if defining a video texture.                                                                                       | 640           |

## Defining Textures

To set a texture on the material, specify the `src` property. `src` can either be a selector to an `<img>` or `<video>` element:

```html
<a-assets>
  <img id="my-texture" src="texture.png">
</a-assets>

<a-scene>
  <a-entity geometry="primitive: box" material="src: #my-texture"></a-entity>
</a-scene>
```

`src` can also be an inline URL:

```html
<a-scene>
  <a-entity geometry="primitive: box" material="src: url(texture.png)"></a-entity>
</a-scene>
```

Most of the other properties works together with textures. For example, the `color` property will act as the base color and be multiplied per-pixel with the texture. Set it to `#fff` to maintain the original colors of the texture.

### Repeating Textures

Often, we want to tile textures rather than having them stretch. The `repeat` property can be used to repeat textures.

```html
<a-entity geometry="primitive: plane; width: 100"
          material="src: carpet.png; repeat: 100 20"></a-entity>
```

### Environment Maps

The `envMap` property defines what environment the material reflects. This also works together with plain textures. Though unlike regular texture maps, the `envMap` property takes a cubemap, six images put together to form a cube. The cubemap is wrapped around the entity and applied as a texture.

If shader is set to `standard`, which it is by default, the clarity of the reflection depends on the `metalness`, `roughness`, and `reflectivity` properties.

```html
<a-assets>
  <a-cubemap id="sky">
    <img src="right.png">
    <img src="left.png">
    <img src="top.png">
    <img src="bottom.png">
    <img src="front.png">
    <img src="back.png">
  </a-cubemap>
</a-assets>

<a-scene>
  <a-entity geometry="primitive: box" material="envMap: #sky; roughness: 0"></a-entity>
</a-scene>
```

## Physically Based Shading

By default, A-Frame materials default to a physically based shading model, where the `shader` property is `standard`. Physically based shading is a recent trend in rendering systems where materials behave realistically to lighting conditions. Appearance is a result of the interaction between the incoming light and the properties of the material.

To achieve realism, the diffuse `color`, `metalness`, `reflectivity`, and `roughness` properties of the material must accurately be controlled, often based on real-world material studies. Some people have compiled charts of realistic
values for different kinds of materials that can be used as a starting point.

For example, for a tree bark material, as an estimation, we might set:

```html
<a-entity geometry="primitive: cylinder"
          material="src: treebark.png; color: #696969; roughness: 1; metalness: 0">
</a-entity>
```

For basic scenes, however, physically based materials are not a large concern.

## Specifying Flat Shading

Since materials default to physically based shading, materials will reflect light when we might not want them to. To specify flat shading, such as in the case for displaying plain images or videos, we can define the `shader` property to be `flat`.

```html
<a-entity geometry="primitive: plane" material="src: #cat-image; shader: flat">
</a-entity>
```
