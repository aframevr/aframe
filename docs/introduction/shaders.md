Shaders are a powerful technique to implement visual effects.

A-Frame provides support for custom shaders as discussed [here][shaders].

In addition, there are components developed by the A-Frame developer community
that allow the use of existing shaders from repositories such as [ShaderToy][shadertoy] and [ShaderFrog][shaderfrog].

Note however that these shaders can be quite demanding in terms of
computational and graphics power, and some more complex shaders may not function 
well on lower-performance devices such as smartphones.
