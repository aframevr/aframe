![360&deg; Image Viewer](/images/docs/360-image-viewer.png)

Let's build an interactive gaze-based **360&deg; image gallery**. There will be
three panels which the user can click on. Once clicked, the background will
fade and swap the 360&deg; images.

[ecs]: ../introduction/entity-component-system.md

This guide will practice three concepts related to [entity-component][ecs]:

1. Using the standard components that come with A-Frame.
2. Using community components from the ecosystem.
3. Writing custom components to accomplish whatever we want.

Not to say 360&deg; images are at all a focus use case of A-Frame, but it makes
for an easy example that has a lot of demand as an early use case on the Web.

## Skeleton

This is the starting point for our scene.

```html
<a-scene>
  <a-assets>
    <audio id="click-sound" src="https://cdn.aframe.io/360-image-gallery-boilerplate/audio/click.ogg"></audio>

    <!-- Images. -->
    <img id="city" src="https://cdn.aframe.io/360-image-gallery-boilerplate/img/city.jpg">
    <img id="city-thumb" src="https://cdn.aframe.io/360-image-gallery-boilerplate/img/thumb-city.jpg">
    <img id="cubes" src="https://cdn.aframe.io/360-image-gallery-boilerplate/img/cubes.jpg">
    <img id="cubes-thumb" src="https://cdn.aframe.io/360-image-gallery-boilerplate/img/thumb-cubes.jpg">
    <img id="sechelt" src="https://cdn.aframe.io/360-image-gallery-boilerplate/img/sechelt.jpg">
    <img id="sechelt-thumb" src="https://cdn.aframe.io/360-image-gallery-boilerplate/img/thumb-sechelt.jpg">
  </a-assets>

  <!-- 360-degree image. -->
  <a-sky id="image-360" radius="10" src="#city"></a-sky>

  <!-- Link template we will build. -->
  <a-entity class="link"></a-entity>

  <!-- Camera + Cursor. -->
  <a-camera>
    <a-cursor
      id="cursor"
      animation__click="property: scale; from: 0.1 0.1 0.1; to: 1 1 1; easing: easeInCubic; dur: 150; startEvents: click"
      animation__clickreset="property: scale; to: 0.1 0.1 0.1; dur: 1; startEvents: animationcomplete__click"
      animation__fusing="property: scale; from: 1 1 1; to: 0.1 0.1 0.1; easing: easeInCubic; dur: 150; startEvents: fusing"></a-cursor>
  </a-camera>
</a-scene>
```

[a-sky]: ../primitives/a-sky.md
[ams]: ../core/asset-management-system.md
[animationevents]: ../components/animation.md#animating-on-events
[camera]: ../primitives/a-camera.md
[component]: ../core/component.md
[cursor]: ../components/cursor.md

We have predefined:

- Several images to *preload* in the [Asset Management System][ams] within
  `<a-assets>`. Note not all our assets must be predefined or preloaded.
- Our 360&deg; image placeholder with [`<a-sky>`][a-sky].
- A [cursor][cursor] with visual feedback using [event-driven
  animations][animationevents], fixed to the [camera][camera].

## Using Standard Components

Standard components are components that ship with A-Frame, like any standard
library. We'll go over how to attach these components to entities and configure
them from HTML.

We want to build a textured plane to act as a link that when clicked, will
change the 360&deg; image. We start with an empty entity. Without any
components, any empty entity does nothing and renders nothing:

```html
<a-entity class="link"></a-entity>
```

[geometry]: ../components/geometry.md

To give our entity shape, we can attach the [geometry component][geometry],
configured to a plane shape. We specify the component data using a syntax that
resembles that of inline CSS styles:

```html
<a-entity
  class="link"
  geometry="primitive: plane; height: 1; width: 1"></a-entity>
```

[material]: ../components/material.md

Then to give our entity appearance, we can attach the [material
component][material].  We set `shader` to `flat` so the image isn't affected
negatively by lighting. And we set `src` to `#cubes-thumb`, a selector to one
of the images preloaded in the [Asset Management System][ams]. Alternatively,
we could pass a URL for the image:

```html
<a-entity class="link"
  geometry="primitive: plane; height: 1; width: 1"
  material="shader: flat; src: #cubes-thumb"></a-entity>
```

[sound]: ../components/sound.md

We can continue adding features to our entity by plugging in more components.
Let's attach one more standard component, the [sound component][sound]. We want
to make it such that when we click (via gazing) on the link, it plays a click
sound. The syntax is the same as before, but instead we are now using the sound
component's properties. We set `on` to `click` so the sound is played on click.
And we set `src` to `#click-sound`, a selector to our `<audio>` element.

```html
<a-entity class="link"
  geometry="primitive: plane; height: 1; width: 1"
  material="shader: flat; src: #cubes-thumb"
  sound="on: click; src: #click-sound"></a-entity>
```

Now we have a textured plane that plays a click sound when clicked.

## Using Community Components

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=aframe-component&page=1&ranking=optimal

A-Frame comes with a small core of standard components, but lot of magic comes
from the large number of open source community components in the A-Frame
ecosystem.  We can find community components from places such as [npm][npm]. We
can drop them into our scene and use them straight in our HTML. Components are
capable of doing anything and abstract hundreds of lines of code into a single
component that can be plugged in via an HTML attribute, like physics!

We'll go through using four community components:

- [event-set](https://supermedium.com/superframe/components/event-set/)
- [layout](https://supermedium.com/superframe/components/layout/)
- [proxy-event](https://supermedium.com/superframe/components/proxy-event/)
- [template](https://supermedium.com/superframe/components/template/)

Community components are generally available through both GitHub and published
on npm. An easy way to include components is to use the [unpkg.com
CDN](http://unpkg.com/), which lets us include components hosted on npm as a
script tag, even with support for specifying fuzzy versions. We usually just
need to know the component's npm package name and the path:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>360Â° Image Browser</title>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.4.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/aframe-template-component@3.x.x/dist/aframe-template-component.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/aframe-layout-component@4.x.x/dist/aframe-layout-component.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/aframe-event-set-component@5.x.x/dist/aframe-event-set-component.min.js"></script>
     <script src="https://unpkg.com/aframe-proxy-event-component@2.1.0/dist/aframe-proxy-event-component.min.jss"></script>
    
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <!-- ... -->
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```

### `template` Component to Create the Links

Currently, we have one link. We want to create three of them, one for each of
our 360&deg; images. We want to be able to reuse the HTML definition for all of
them.

One solution is the [template component][template], which integrates templating
engines into A-Frame at runtime.  This lets us do things such as encapsulate
groups of entities, passing data to generate entities, or iteration. Since we
want to turn one link into three, without copy-and-pasting HTML, we can use the
template component.

[Super Nunjucks Webpack Loader]: https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-super-hot-loader/tree/master/example

> Ideally, we would do this at build time (e.g., with the [Super Nunjucks Webpack Loader]),
> instead of wasting time doing it at runtime. But for simplicity for this
> tutorial to demonstrate components, we will use the template component. In
> practice, we'd want to do it with a module bundler such as Webpack.

[template]: https://github.com/supermedium/superframe/tree/master/components/template#aframe-template-component

If we read the [template component's documentation][template], we see one way
to define a template is via a script tag in `<head>`. Let's make our link a
template and give it a name using an `id`:

```html
<head>
  <!-- ... -->
  <script id="link" type="text/html">
    <a-entity class="link"
      geometry="primitive: plane; height: 1; width: 1"
      material="shader: flat; src: #cubes-thumb"
      sound="on: click; src: #click-sound"></a-entity>
  </script>
</head>
```

Then we can use the template to create multiple planes without much work:

```html
<a-entity template="src: #link"></a-entity>
<a-entity template="src: #link"></a-entity>
<a-entity template="src: #link"></a-entity>
```

[templateliteral]: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals

But then they'll all be displaying the same image texture and look the same.
Here is where we'll need a template engine with variable substitution. The
template component comes with simple [ES6 string
interpolation][templateliteral] (i.e., `${var}` format).

[data]: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes

To allow each instance of the template to be customizable, we define a
`${thumb}` variable in the template, which we can pass using [data
attributes][data]:

```html
<a-assets>
  <!-- ... -->
  <script id="link" type="text/html">
    <a-entity class="link"
      geometry="primitive: plane; height: 1; width: 1"
      material="shader: flat; src: ${thumb}"
      sound="on: click; src: #click-sound"></a-entity>
  </script>
</a-assets>

<!-- ... -->

<!-- Pass image sources to the template. -->
<a-entity template="src: #link" data-thumb="#city-thumb"></a-entity>
<a-entity template="src: #link" data-thumb="#cubes-thumb"></a-entity>
<a-entity template="src: #link" data-thumb="#sechelt-thumb"></a-entity>
```

The template component has allowed us to not have to repeat a lot of HTML,
keeping our scene very readable.

### `layout` Component to Lay Out Links

[layout]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-layout-component

Because the default position of an entity is `0 0 0`, the entities will
overlap. While we could manually position each link, we could instead use the
[layout component][layout] to do it for us. The layout component will
automatically position its children to the specified layout.

We create a wrapper entity around our links and attach the layout component
using the `line` layout:

```html
<a-entity id="links" layout="type: line; margin: 1.5" position="-1.5 -1 -4">
  <a-entity template="src: #link" data-thumb="#city-thumb"></a-entity>
  <a-entity template="src: #link" data-thumb="#cubes-thumb"></a-entity>
  <a-entity template="src: #link" data-thumb="#sechelt-thumb"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

Now our links are no longer overlapping without us having to calculate and
fiddle with positions. The layout component supports other layouts including
grid, circle, and dodecahedron. The layout component is fairly simple, but we
can imagine in the future, they can get more and more powerful while retaining
the same simplicity of use.

### `event-set` Component for Visual Feedback on Hover

[cursorevents]: ../components/cursor.md#events
[eventset]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-event-set-component
[scale]: ../components/scale.md

Lastly, we'll add some visual feedback to our links. We want them to scale up
and scale back when they are hovered or clicked. This involves writing an event
listener to do `setAttribute`s on the [scale component][scale] in response to
[cursor events][cursorevents]. This is a fairly common pattern so there is an
[event-set component][eventset] that does `setAttribute` in response to events.

[multiple]: ../core/component.md#multiple

Let's attach event listeners on our links to scale them up when they are gazed
over, scale them down as they are being clicked, and scale them back when they
are no longer gazed upon. We can specify event names either the `_event`
property or via the `__<id>` as shown below. The rest of the properties define
the `setAttribute` calls. Notice that the event-set component can have
[multiple instances][multiple]:

```html
<script id="link" type="text/html">
  <a-entity class="link"
    geometry="primitive: plane; height: 1; width: 1"
    material="shader: flat; src: ${thumb}"
    sound="on: click; src: #click-sound"
    event-set__mouseenter="scale: 1.2 1.2 1"
    event-set__mouseleave="scale: 1 1 1"
    event-set__click="_target: #image-360; _delay: 300; material.src: ${src}"></a-entity>
</script>
```

Remember to add `data-src` attributes to the link entities to load the full image on click:

```
<a-entity template="src: #link" data-src="#city" data-thumb="#city-thumb"></a-entity>
<a-entity template="src: #link" data-src="#cubes" data-thumb="#cubes-thumb"></a-entity>
<a-entity template="src: #link" data-src="#sechelt" data-thumb="#sechelt-thumb"></a-entity>
```

Next, we want to actually set the new background image. We'll add a nice fade-to-black effect.

The last `event-set__click` is more complex in that it sets a property on
another entity (our background noted as ID `#image-360`) with a delay of 300,
setting the texture with `material.src`. The delay of 300 will allow for the
fade-to-black animation to run before setting the texture.

## `proxy-event` Component to Change the Background

Next, we want to wire up the click on the link to actually changing the
background. We can use `proxy-set` to pass an event from one entity to
another. It's a convenient way for telling the background that one of the links
was clicked in order to begin the animation:

```html
<a-entity
  class="link"
  <!-- ... -->
  proxy-event="event: click; to: #image-360; as: fade"></a-entity>
```

When the link is clicked, it will emit the event also on our background (IDed
as `#image-360`), renaming the event from `click` to `fade`. Now let's handle this event
to begin the animation:

```html
<!-- 360-degree image. -->
<a-sky
  id="image-360" radius="10" src="#city"
  animation__fade="property: components.material.material.color; type: color; from: #FFF; to: #000; dur: 300; startEvents: fade"
  animation__fadeback="property: components.material.material.color; type: color; from: #000; to: #FFF; dur: 300; startEvents: animationcomplete__fade"></a-sky>
```

We set two animations, one setting the color to fade to black, and one setting
the color to fade back to normal. The `animation__fade` sets to black,
listening to the `fade` event that we "proxied" earlier.

The `animation__fadeback` is interesting in that we start it once the
`animation__fade` completes by listening to the `animationcomplete__fade` event
that is emitted by animation component when an animation finishes. We
effectively chained these animations!

[Writing a Component]: ../introduction/writing-a-component.md

Wielding components, we were able to do a lot in a few dozen lines of HTML,
working on VR across most headsets and browsers. Though the ecosystem has a lot
to offer for common needs, non-trivial VR applications will require us to write
application-specific components. That is covered in [Writing a Component] and
hopefully in later guides.
