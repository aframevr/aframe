## Top-Level Goals

- **Community:** help people get involved with WebVR in a fun and welcoming environment

The roadmap has recently and largely defined through battle-testing A-Frame by
the Supermedium team to build the browser, content, and tools. We will release
open source mini-games for examples to follow, continue to push reusable
components we create, guides, etc.

- three.js upgrades
- Animation component (https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-animation-component)
- Inspector improvements (fixes, plug-ins, removal of unused features)
- Toolchain improvements (support model animations)
- Continued performance improvements (https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/2951)
