# Roadmap

## Top-Level Goals

- **Community:** help people get involved with WebVR in a fun and welcoming environment
- **Performance:** maintain high framerate with low latency
- **Ecosystem:** enable discovery and distribution of reusable components

## 0.8.0 (est. Nov 2017)

- Vive tracker support (#2582)
- Replace VREffect / VRControls with new three.js WebVR API
- System API enhancements (e.g., refactor to inherit from component API, entity added and removed handlers)
- Asset management improvements (e.g., loading screen, duplicate requests in FileLoader)
- Spectator Camera (ability to show different views in headset and 2D monitor)
- Input Mapping to easily map app-specific actions with controller buttons and axes
