> For the core library, check out [A-Frame Core](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core/).

__Building blocks for the VR Web.__

- **Virtual Reality**: Drop in the library and have a WebVR scene within a few lines of markup.
- **Based on the DOM**: Manipulate with JavaScript, use with your favorite [libraries and frameworks](https://github.com/aframevr/awesome-aframe).
- **[Entity-Component System](https://aframe.io/docs/core/)**: Use the entity-component system for better composability and flexibility.
