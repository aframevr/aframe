# Governance & Code of Conduct

This document outlines the governance structure of A-Frame as an independent
and open source project as well as the code of conduct for the community.

## Governance

Governance outlines the set of people that lead the project, its vision, and
its community as well as detailing how final decisions are carried out. A-Frame
is governed by a core team of project maintainers, which is ultimately
responsible for all decision-making in the project. Specifically, project
maintainers:

- Set the overall direction and vision for the project
- Set the priorities and release schedule
- Make final decisions when consensus cannot be reached
- Uphold the code of conduct

[@donmccurdy]: https://github.com/donmccurdy
[@ngokevin]: https://github.com/ngokevin

Current project maintainers consist of:

- [Diego Marcos](@dmarcos) - <dmarcos@mozilla.com>
- [Don McCurdy](@donmccurdy) - <dm@donmccurdy.com>
- [Kevin Ngo](@ngokevin) <me@ngokevin.com>

Project maintainers have and are expected to provide:

- Sustained, significant, and quality contribution.
- Technical knowledge of 3D, VR, three.js, and A-Frame.
- Responsive support and engagement to the community.
- Demonstration of the code of conduct.

- [Fabien Benetou](@utopiah) - <fabien-services@benetou.fr>

### Decision Making

Final decisions should take into account:

- A level of consensus-building has been achieved. This means that everyone's
  points were at least addressed but not necessarily accepted or compromised
  upon. No point should feel ignored. This not only applies to team members;
  any community members are welcome to voice their input in any discussion.
- Supporting evidence is provided that the decision would benefit the project
  as whole. In the case of community-based decisions, decisions should be made
  given knowledge of being immersed in the community rather through
  assumptions.
- Being versed in discussion thus far and relevant technical details.
- The long-term direction and vision of the project. While sometimes a decision
  may help a project in the short term, it can cause maintenance or technical
  debt in the long term.

The decisions of the project maintainers are contained to the
[aframevr](https://github.com/aframevr) GitHub organization, its repositories,
and social forums (Slack, Twitter, Facebook).

## Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct provides a document that can be referenced to in cases of
conflict. Fortunately, most people in the community do not need a document to
tell them how to behave decently in public, but we have it to fall back on:

- We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
  all, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression,
  sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race,
  ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
- Avoid unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or
  jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
- Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
  implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom
  a right answer.
- Please keep unstructured and non-actionable critique to a minimum. If you
  have solid ideas you want to experiment with, create your own project or
  initiative, gain feedback, and see how it works.
- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.
  We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the
  [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/).
- Private harassment is unacceptable.
- Avoid defaming other people. If you do not have anything nice to say, try to
  not say it at all.
- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
  behaviour is not welcome.

Try not to take any disagreements, code reviews, technical decisions, nor forms
of discourse personally or as attacks. All decisions made should be made
without bias towards any of the participants. If you feel this is not being
upheld, please contact any of the project maintainers or moderators, or raise
your concerns in the forums.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct. If
you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact one of the moderators.

- Remarks that violate the A-Frame standards of conduct, including hateful,
  hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is
  allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)
- Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of
  conduct or not, are also not allowed.
- Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
- If the warning is unheeded, the user will be kicked, i.e., kicked out of the
  communication channel to cool off.
- If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned,
  i.e., indefinitely excluded.
- Moderators may choose at their discretion to unban the user if it was a
  first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
- If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it
  up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, in private. Complaints
  about bans in-channel are not allowed.
- Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a
  moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway
  than others.

Moderators are people to contact or bring in if any issues arise. They include
the listed project maintainers and moderators. Contact any of the moderators
listed above if you have any issues in the community that should be resolved.
The policies apply to official A-Frame venues; GitHub repositories under
`aframevr` and forums (Slack, Twitter, Facebook, meetups).
